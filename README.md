# DESPER

An [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app for browsing images and setting them as your **des**ktop wallpap**er**. Built to showcase some of Electron's features for [a talk I gave at SEM.js](http://www.meetup.com/SEM-JS/events/232384436/).

* Imagery from [NPYL's Digital Collections](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/) via [their API](http://api.repo.nypl.org/)
* Some CSS styles borrowed from Electron's [API demo app](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos)
